# YouTube-engagement-analyzer
Deep-dive into 10,000+ rows of my YouTube watch history (Marâ€“Nov 2024). Used YouTube API, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to extract, clean, and analyze viewing dataâ€”uncovering patterns in binge sessions, content themes, and watch-time habits. A showcase of EDA and data storytelling skills.

What did I do?
âœ… Extracted a dataset of 10,000+ rows and 9 columns using:<br>
YouTube API to retrieve video IDs<br>
Web scraping (Selenium & BeautifulSoup) to extract video titles<br>

 âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed the dataâ€”handling missing values, treating outliers, and standardizing columns<br>
 âœ… Analyzed key consumption patterns, including:<br>
Time of Day Trends â€“ When am I watching the most?<br>
Long-Form vs. Shorts â€“ Do I prefer quick clips or deep dives?<br>
Weekday vs. Weekend Viewing â€“ Do weekends mean more binge-watching?<br>
Content Themes â€“ What topics do I watch the most?<br>
Binge Sessions & Recurring Videos â€“ What makes me rewatch certain content?<br>
Watch Time Fluctuations â€“ What triggers spikes in consumption?<br>

Few Interesting Findings:<br>

ðŸ“Œ I watched almost 1,400 videos in Julyâ€”turns out I was super paranoid about moving to the U.S. for my masterâ€™s and was trying to do as much research as possible. ðŸ˜‚<br>
ðŸ“Œ 73% of the content I watch is long-form videos, and Iâ€™ve had some serious binge-watching sessions.<br>
ðŸ“Œ One other key takeaway? I watch a LOT of stand-up comedy (Shoutout to my fellow Shane Gillis fans)!
