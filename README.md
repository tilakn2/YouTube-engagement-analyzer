# YouTube-engagement-analyzer
Deep-dive into 10,000+ rows of my YouTube watch history (Marâ€“Nov 2024). Used YouTube API, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup to extract, clean, and analyze viewing dataâ€”uncovering patterns in binge sessions, content themes, and watch-time habits. A showcase of EDA and data storytelling skills.

What did I do?
âœ… Extracted a dataset of 10,000+ rows and 9 columns using:
YouTube API to retrieve video IDs
Web scraping (Selenium & BeautifulSoup) to extract video titles

 âœ… Cleaned and preprocessed the dataâ€”handling missing values, treating outliers, and standardizing columns

 âœ… Analyzed key consumption patterns, including:
Time of Day Trends â€“ When am I watching the most?
Long-Form vs. Shorts â€“ Do I prefer quick clips or deep dives?
Weekday vs. Weekend Viewing â€“ Do weekends mean more binge-watching?
Content Themes â€“ What topics do I watch the most?
Binge Sessions & Recurring Videos â€“ What makes me rewatch certain content?
Watch Time Fluctuations â€“ What triggers spikes in consumption?

Few Interesting Findings:

ðŸ“Œ I watched almost 1,400 videos in Julyâ€”turns out I was super paranoid about moving to the U.S. for my masterâ€™s and was trying to do as much research as possible. ðŸ˜‚

ðŸ“Œ 73% of the content I watch is long-form videos, and Iâ€™ve had some serious binge-watching sessions.

One other key takeaway? I watch a LOT of stand-up comedy (Shoutout to my fellow Shane Gillis fans)!
